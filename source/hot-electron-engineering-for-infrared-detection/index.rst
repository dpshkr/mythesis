Hot electron engineering in layered heterojunction for efficient infrared detection
=====================================================================================

Infrared (IR) photodetection is of great importance for a wide variety of technologies. 
Photodetection in the wavelength range in the C band (1528–1561 nm) and the L band (1561–1620 nm) is of great
interest for optical communication systems
