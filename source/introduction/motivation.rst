Motivation
===========

In the previous sections, we have discussed the opportunities and challenges for low-dimensional material-based devices.
In this thesis, we try to address some of these challenges.
The main challenge for transistor applications is getting high-performance devices at lower energies. This often involves mitigating contact resistance. 
For optoelectronic devices, the challenge has been to get stable devices to detect even low-energy electromagnetic radiation with high responsivity and good speed. These challenges have been the main motivational guiding forces behind this work.
