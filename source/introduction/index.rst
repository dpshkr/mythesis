Introduction
==============

Low-dimensional materials are materials in which the constituent atoms/molecules are strongly bonded (usually by covalent bonds) along some dimensions while weakly (van der Waals bonds) bonded along others.
This leads to two possibilities - two-dimensional and one-dimensional materials. 
In two-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 2D plane, while along the third dimension, the bonding is weak. 
In one-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 1D line, 
while the bonding is weak along the other two dimensions.

The discovery of extremely thin (single layer of carbon atoms) yet stable 2D layers like graphene :cite:p:`novoselov2005two` and ultra-thin single-wall carbon nanotubes :cite:p:`iijima1993single` has led numerous researchers across the globe to dive into the exciting world of low-dimensional materials to address problems of technological importance as well as fundamental understanding of nature.
