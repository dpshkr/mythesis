Introduction
==============

Low-dimensional materials are materials in which the constituent atoms/molecules are strongly bonded (usually by covalent bonds) along some dimensions while weakly (van der Waals bonds) bonded along others.
This leads to two possibilities - two-dimensional and one-dimensional materials. 
In two-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 2D plane, while along the third dimension, the bonding is weak. 
In one-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 1D line, 
while the bonding is weak along the other two dimensions.
