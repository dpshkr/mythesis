Thesis Organizatiom
=====================

The rest of the thesis is organized into the following chapters -

**Chapter 2**: Here, we explore gate-all-around junctionless transistor architecture, a suitable structure for sub-5nm technology node due to its excellent electrostatics, using the tellurium nanowires.
Further, we use h-BN, a two-dimensional insulator, as the gate dielectric. 
The combination of the unique material properties and the device architecture helped us fabricate p-type transistors with field-effect mobility of 570 cm²/V·s, a high drive current of 216 mA/mm and an on-off ratio of 2×10⁴.

**Chapter 3**: Using partially overlapping gates, we present an electrically defined self-aligned SnSe₂/WSe₂ heterostructure device.
The device operates as n-type and p-type transistors by applying appropriate gate biases. 
The device can also be used as a test platform to discern the properties of the heterojunction without confounding the effects of contact resistance. 
This device can be operated as a tunnel transistor as well. 
At room temperature, the device exhibits a subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/dec.

**Chapter 4**: In this chapter, we present a vertically integrated double-channel transistor based on ultrathin 2D material to meet these challenges. The device structure effectively increases the contact area, thus reducing the contact resistance by about a factor of two without compromising the device footprint or electrostatic integrity. The proposed device structure achieves a high drive current of over 400 mA/mm.

**Chapter 5**: Here, we present infra-red detection using stable wide-bandgap material heterostructure and electron transition from one material's conduction band to the other's conduction band. We propose multiple device architectures to understand the mechanism of the device operation from their bias-dependent photo response and simple physical models. The device exhibits the responsivity of ~40 mA/W when excited with 1550 nm wavelength IR radiation. The device operates and exhibits a nearly flat response up to 1800 nm, and a signal above the noise floor could be observed up to 30 kHz.

**Chapter 6** concludes the findings of this work and discusses the future scope.
