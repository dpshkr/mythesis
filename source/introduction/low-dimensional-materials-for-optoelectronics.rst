Low-dimensional materials for optoelectronics and photonics
============================================================

Low-dimensional materials have many interesting properties that can be utilized for various optoelectronic 
:cite:p:`wang2012electronics,an2022perspectives` applications like photodetectors :cite:p:`murali2019highly,amani2018solution`, solar cells :cite:p:`koo2024mesoporous,tsai2014monolayer`, light-emitting devices :cite:p:`withers2015wse2,lien2018large`, single photon emitters :cite:p:`chhaperwal2024simultaneously` and single photon detectors :cite:p:`NithinSinglePhoton`. 
The availability of a large library of these materials with a wide range of bandgaps has made them suitable for photodetectors for a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. The thickness-dependent tunability of the bandgap has further added to their advantage :cite:p:`nidhi2022impact,buscema2014fast`. 
Semimetals like graphene have been used for ultrafast broadband photoresponse :cite:p:`xia2009ultrafast`.
Many low-dimensional materials (partly due to strong quantum confinement) show interesting properties from quasiparticles like excitons, trions, etc :cite:p:`chatterjee2023harmonic`.

Another major advantage of low-dimensional materials in optoelectronics arises from the ability to form heterojunctions. 
Heterojunctions with a wide variety of properties can be fabricated for efficient carrier generation and collection in the case of photodetectors and carrier recombination and light emission in the case of light-emitting devices. The gain-bandwidth tradeoff has been one of the major limitations of optoelectronics using low-dimensional materials :cite:p:`kufer2015highly`. This comes from traps at the semiconductor-substrate interfaces :cite:p:`han2019ambient` and the lack of integration with sensing and detection circuits and systems.
