Electrically Self-Aligned, Reconfigurable Test Structure Using WSe₂/SnSe₂ Heterojunction for TFET and MOSFET
==============================================================================================================

The main driving force behind the rapid growth in digital technology has
been scaling the transistors to extremely small dimensions. This
reduction of dimensions has resulted in the possibility of packing more
transistors in a given area leading to an increase in the computing power
as well as functionality of electronic devices. Smaller dimensions
also lead to a smaller capacitance of the devices which helps in increasing
the frequency of operation of transistors. However, the minimum supply
voltage possible for transistors has been limited by the fundamental
Boltzmann limit, according to which, when carriers are injected into
the channel from the source through thermionic injection, the subthreshold
slope cannot be less than 60 mV/decade at room temperature. This inability to scale supply
voltage has led to a rapid increase in the power consumption of transistors.
