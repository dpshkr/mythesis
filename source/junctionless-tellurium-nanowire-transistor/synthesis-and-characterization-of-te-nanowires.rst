Synthesis and characterization of Te nanowires
================================================

The Te nanowires are synthesized :cite:p:`roy2017manipulation` using Na₂O₃
as a precursor in the water medium, where hydrazine hydrate is used as a reducing
agent, Polyvinylpyrrolidone( PVP) as a capping agent, and Ammonia is used to maintain proper
pH. In a typical experiment, 1 g of PVP (average. M.W.= 58,000)
is dissolved in 20 ml of DI water and 92 mg Na₂O₃
is dissolved in 15 ml DI water separately. Both solutions are mixed
at room temperature. Into the above solution, 1.5 ml of Hydrazine hydrate
and 3.3 ml of 25\% aqueous ammonia solution are added drop-wise with
moderate stirring. The transparent solution is then transferred
to a 50 ml capacity teflon container. Then the hydrothermal reaction
is allowed to take place for 4 hours at 180 °C. After the
reaction vessel cools down to room temperature, the solution is cleaned
twelve times using hot water (60 °C) at 8000 revolutions per minute
and subsequently two times using ethanol.
