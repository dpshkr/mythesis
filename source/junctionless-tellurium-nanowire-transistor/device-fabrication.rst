Device Fabrication
====================

The step-by-step fabrication process of the junctionless FET is illustrated in :ref:`Figure 2.3 <ch01-plasma-clean-01>`. 
We drop cast the Te nanowires onto a degenerately doped Si substrate coated with 285 nm thick, thermally grown, high quality SiO₂. 
A low-power Ar treatment is then performed to remove any residual PVP coating from the nanowires. 
A thin layer of high-quality hBN (∼ 15 nm) is immediately transferred onto the nanowire using a dry transfer technique :cite:p:`Castellanos_Gomez_2014` to define the top gate dielectric. 
The atomically smooth surface of the dangling-bond-free hBN gate dielectric provides an ideal interface with the dangling-bond-free Te nanowire channel.

Subsequently, electron beam lithography is performed to define the source, the drain, and the gate metallization areas. 
To remove any unintentional residue and surface oxidation :cite:p`lan2007dispersibility` from the source/drain region of the
nanowire, a second plasma cleaning step is performed, which improves the contact interface quality. 
Ni/Au is then deposited using DC magnetron sputtering, followed by lift-off in acetone to complete the device fabrication. 
More details of the fabrication are provided in Appendix \ref{a01_00}.

We find that an optimum plasma cleaning is a crucial step in the fabrication, which helps remove residual PVP capping layer and possible interfacial oxide, improving the interface quality and reducing the contact resistance. A careful optimization shows that Ar plasma cleaning for 20 s at a power level of 10 W (electrode area of 10 cm diameter)  and a pressure of 10 mbar results in the optimum device performance. The :ref:`Figures 2.4 <ch01-plasma-clean-02>`\(a)-(b)
show the STEM images of two different nanowires, one without the plasma cleaning
and the other after plasma cleaning for 20 s, respectively. The plasma-cleaned nanowire clearly shows superior surface quality.

The electrical characteristics of a nanowire without plasma cleaning are shown in :ref:`Figures 2.5 <ch01-plasma-clean-03>`\(a) at various temperatures from 7 to 200 K. The characteristics show very low current levels and fast current saturation.
Such an observation has also been made previously for devices using two-dimensional layer materials
:cite:p:`ho2017high`. On the other hand, the nanowires with plasma cleaning show a 1000-fold enhancement in the current drive at similar external bias, indicating superior contact quality as shown in :ref:`Figures 2.5 <ch01-plasma-clean-03>`\(b)
