Dual Channel FET for High Current and Low Contact Resistance Transistors
==========================================================================

Scaling transistors to tiny dimensions has been one of the key reasons behind the onset of the information era. 
The spread of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on massive data sets has created extreme computing requirements.
Such high-performance computing would require transistors that give large current drives with low footprints so that larger systems can be integrated into smaller areas. 
MBCFETs (Multi-channel bridge FETs) have been promising transistor designs that offer a planar solution to device scaling.
